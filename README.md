# Game of Thrones Death Prediction Project

## Problem Statement and Algorithms

Our project aims to predict the deaths of Game of Thrones characters after each battle using three different algorithms: logistic regression, decision-making, and decision tree algorithms. We will leverage a dataset from Kaggle, featuring 170 characters with information such as death years, character death age, nobility status, gender, and alliance.

### Algorithms:

1. **Logistic Regression:**
   - Suitable for predicting Game of Thrones character deaths due to its simplicity and interpretability.
   - Analyzes the relationship between input features (age, nobility status, gender) and the binary outcome of death or survival.

2. **Random Forest:**
   - Robust choice for predicting deaths, handling non-linear relationships and capturing complex interactions.
   - Identifies patterns that simpler models might miss, essential in a narrative like Game of Thrones.

3. **Gradient Boosting:**
   - Employs algorithms like XGBoost and LightGBM to iteratively improve predictions.
   - Focuses on correcting errors from previous models, yielding high accuracy in complex narratives.

## Expected System Behaviors

Our system's primary goal is to predict Game of Thrones character deaths post-battles by analyzing factors like death date, age, nobility status, gender, and alliance. Logistic regression and decision-making algorithms are employed to understand historical data and identify patterns and correlations between features and the likelihood of a character's death. The system attempts to predict not only if a character will die but also the sequence of deaths based on factors like age and alliance.

## Key Focus Areas

We will focus on evaluating the performance of logistic regression, decision-making, and decision tree algorithms. Key areas of investigation include:
- Identification of features contributing accurately to death predictions.
- Analysis of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate algorithm effectiveness.
